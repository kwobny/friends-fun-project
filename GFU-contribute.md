# Contributing to project with Github for Unity  

This document describes how to contribute to the project using Github for Unity.
It is meant for people who don't really know how to use git well.  

1. This step only needs to be done once (per unity project) to setup things.
If you already did this before, move on to step 2.  
Launch a terminal in the directory of the project. Then run the command below:  
    
        git config pull.rebase true
    
It is also recommended to also run this command. This only has to be run once (once for all time, not once per project).

git config --global fetch.prune true
git config --global pull.rebase true
