# Contributing to project with Github for Unity  

This document describes how to contribute to the project using Github for Unity.
It is meant for people who don't really know how to use git well.  

1.  This step only needs to be done once (for all time) to setup things.
    If you already did this before, move on to step 2.  
    Launch a terminal (no specific path). Then run the command below:  
    
        git config --global fetch.prune true && git config --global pull.rebase merges
